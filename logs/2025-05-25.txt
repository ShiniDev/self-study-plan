I got my website to work finally! I used caddy as my reverse proxy so I can have automatic https,
basically it receives all traffic from my server, then sends it internally to my nginx container which is cool.

Now I'm getting familliar with using composer inside a docker container, I didn't know that running composer update
inside a docker container which has volume would also affect the host machine, which is cool too.
