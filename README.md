# Mark's Backend Development Relaunch: Study Plan

## Goal
To become a job-ready modern PHP Backend Developer by intensively updating my skills, mastering Laravel, and building compelling portfolio projects. This plan aims to leverage my 2+ years of professional PHP experience and 2 years of a Computer Science academic background for an efficient transition back into development within the next 3-6 months (starting May 2025).

## My "Why"
I want to move away from physically demanding work into a mentally stimulating and financially rewarding career that allows me to build a better future for myself, my girlfriend (future wife!), and my family. I don't want to be stuck in the $15-$20/hr range; I aim to achieve more.

## Core Principles
* **Leverage Existing Knowledge:** Build upon my current understanding; don't relearn what's already solid. Focus on modernization and new skills.
* **Hands-On Every Day:** Consistent practical application is crucial. Write code daily.
* **Project-Centric:** Apply new concepts immediately to small exercises and then integrate them into significant portfolio projects.
* **Prioritize Marketable Skills:** Focus on technologies and practices that employers are actively seeking for modern backend roles.
* **Consistency & Discipline:** Treat this study plan like a part-time job, maintaining a regular and focused schedule.
