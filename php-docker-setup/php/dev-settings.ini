; Log errors to stderr so they appear in `docker logs`
; For PHP-FPM, it might already log to stderr/stdout by default,
; but this ensures it if you were using a different SAPI or want to be explicit.
error_log = /dev/stderr
; Alternatively, log to a file inside the container (make sure path is writable)
; error_log = /var/www/html/logs/php_errors.log

; General Development Settings
date.timezone = "America/New_York" ; Set to your local timezone
short_open_tag = Off               ; Recommended for compatibility
expose_php = Off                   ; Good security practice, even in dev

; Resource Limits (Adjust these based on your project's needs)
memory_limit = 512M                ; Increased memory limit
post_max_size = 64M                ; For larger POST requests (e.g., file uploads)
upload_max_filesize = 64M          ; For larger file uploads
max_execution_time = 120           ; Increased execution time for potentially long scripts in dev
max_input_vars = 3000              ; Useful for complex forms or frameworks

; OPcache Settings for Development (Can improve performance, but ensure changes are picked up)
; OPcache is usually enabled by default in recent PHP versions.
; These settings help ensure that code changes are reflected quickly during development.
opcache.enable = 1
opcache.enable_cli = 1                 ; Enable for CLI scripts too
opcache.revalidate_freq = 0            ; Check file timestamps on every request (0) or every few seconds (e.g., 1)
opcache.validate_timestamps = 1        ; Crucial: tells OPcache to check for updated scripts
opcache.memory_consumption = 128       ; OPcache memory
opcache.interned_strings_buffer = 16   ;
opcache.max_accelerated_files = 10000  ;
; opcache.jit_buffer_size = 0 ; Consider disabling JIT in dev if you suspect issues, or configure appropriately.
                              ; For PHP 8.0+, JIT is off by default unless explicitly configured.

; Session Settings (Defaults are often fine, but you can customize)
; session.save_handler = files
; session.save_path = "/tmp" ; Ensure this path is writable by the PHP process
; session.gc_probability = 1
; session.gc_divisor = 100
; session.cookie_httponly = 1
; session.cookie_samesite = "Lax"
